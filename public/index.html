            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Leon de Klerk and I'm a 20 year old CSE student from the TU Delft (Netherlands).
                I'm one of those tech / space fanatic people who also does some programming and things. <br>
                <br>
                I usually work on some random things and projects, trying to improve my skills and knowledge.
                I work on things likes websites, random program's and (useless?) Android applications
                and I'm planning to keep doing that (I mean just for fun, why not?).
                I'm capable of doing at least some (basic) things in a couple of languages: Java, PHP, Javascript and
                always willing to learn more.<br>
                <br>
                This website is more a bit of a random project, meaning it does not really have content.
                But it provides some basic information about me, if you managed to get here (maybe via one of my apps?),
                but I had fun creating it and trying some stuff in the process.<br>
                <br>
                If you want to contact me for whatever, you can do so via one of the contact details supplied below.
                I'm always interested in fun / interesting projects or just some chitchat.<br>

                    <h1>When to Leave</h1>
                    <p>When to Leave is an app that allows you to calculate at what
                        time you need to leave to arrive on time on your destination,
                        given a known travel time.

                        I developed this app as a high school project.
                        Though I got to admit it's usefulness is limited,
                        it did help me get started on Android development.

                    <p>
                        Gyroblock is a simple game where you have to use gyroscopic
                        controls to move a block trough an endless loop of obstacles.
                        The more obstacles you avoid the higher your score will be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gyroblock was a high school project as well,
                        challenging myself on a new level of application development,
                        since developing a game is quite different from developing a static functional app.

                        Fiets locatie, is a simple application (in Dutch), to save the location of your bike.
                        Especially created for saving the location in the train stations.

                        The motivation for this app was pure laziness,
                        since I think it is quicker to enter the details in my app then to use my notes.
                        Since some other people might share my opinion,
                        I decided to just share the app for anyone who think it's useful.
